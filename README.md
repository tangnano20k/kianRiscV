 Here is an RV32IMA RISC-V processor that can boot and run uLinux, 
 initially for the ULX3S 85F. The thing can be easily ported to other platforms. 
 The images for the operating system can be found under the demo directory with instructions.

 I started with logic design in 2020. I got an Orange Crab and ran Litex Linux
 on it. I was speechless. I didn't really know what an FPGA was yet. I had done
 some logic design in my studies and a lot of electrical engineering, computer
 architecture, etc., but I never really had an interest in FPGAs because I
 focused on software modules in my studies. In 2021, I started with my first
 CPU, which I learned through my edX course: Building a RISC-V Core, followed by
 courses from Harris, Computer Architecture, and Digital Design. I have done
 many designs in my spare time in the evenings. Actually, I am an embedded
 software developer and develop kernel drivers and many other low-level
 programs. The idea of booting Linux was actually born from the beginning, as I
 love Linux and am a big Unix admirer. My idols are Ken Thompson and Seymour
 Cray, among many others. I also spend a lot of time with computer history
 because I find the machines very fascinating. In the end, my hobby is the
 fulfillment of my childhood, as I always wanted to know how such a machine
 works. I always read articles in magazines, but that was too abstract for me.
 It's much better if you develop a CPU system yourself, then you can feel and
 understand it.

Last year in the fall, I completed my 5-stage pipeline CPU and wanted to create
a Linux-capable system from it. However, I abandoned the project because I
lacked the knowledge of what is needed for Linux. I had worked with other
designs, such as PSRAM and SDRAM, and implemented them. Then I got MicroPython
running on my SoC at the time. There, I learned how to interactively communicate
with the CPU via UART. This laid the foundation for a Linux system. I then
started studying ice40linux and expanded it with PSRAM and an AXI Light Burst
interface. That was a good learning experience.

Then I read a book about operating systems and memory concepts. I then worked
with xv6 as an operating system in QEMU and learned about privilege modes. I
began creating an emulator based on QEMU, ultraembedded, minirv32im, etc., from
scratch and only then understood what !mmu Linux is. I always wanted a proper
Linux system. However, I recognized the potential in it, as the privilege
concepts don't differ semantically, except that the supervisor mode is not used,
and it only makes sense with an MMU. After my emulator booted !mmu
Linux, I was very happy and started to expand my old multicycle CPU to
!mmu. I succeeded in doing so. I was able to use my buildroot from
minirv32 without any modifications. Through minirv32, I learned about
the relevant hardware addresses and dtb handling.
Regym's patch was the starting point, and he was the first to have an !mmu SoC.
However, I couldn't benefit from it because I didn't understand it. The
understanding came with the emulator.

he following FPGA boards are currently supported: 
tangNano20K, iceSugarPro and ulx3s. If the ulx3s does not work, 
change qspi to spi in the define header to 1'b0. 
Generally speaking, if something does not work, 
reduce the system clock in the define header to a different clock frequency.

I have also managed to run the design on Colorlight i5, i9, and the icoboard.
Support for these boards will follow. Additionally, I have implemented a simple
SPI controller that was able to mount NOR flash via JFFS2 and VFAT SDCard,
allowing operations to be performed on it.
I'm not checking it in because I want to keep the design simple. My goal will
be a different SoC (System on Chip). This SoC is only for learning purposes and
is relatively easy to read and well-organized. One can buy the book 'Digital Design and Computer
Architecture' by Harris and understand my design well with it.

Furthermore, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my chat friend
darkriscv for his patience and the evening chats we've had.
